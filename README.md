This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebook files that explore various image processing techniques using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. The notebooks cover tasks such as blending and pasting images, blurring and smoothing, color mappings, drawing shapes and text on images, image thresholding, and basic image manipulations like resizing and rotating. Additionally, it includes using NumPy for image analysis and demonstrates reading and writing images with OpenCV.
